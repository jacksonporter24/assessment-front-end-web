<h1>JACKSON'S NEIGHBORHOOD</h1>

<body>
    <h2>LEHI, UTAH</h2>
    <p>Lehi is gigantic. Jackson lives in a newer development. Because of that, he is unable to provide any interesting information about his neighborhood. His in-laws live behind him and they have a pool. That's the cool place to go.</p>
    <h3>RESTAURANTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cupbop</li>
        <li>Lehi Bakery</li>
        <li>CHOM Burger</li>

    </ul>
